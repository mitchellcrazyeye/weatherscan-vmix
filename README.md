# weatherscan-VMix
An attempt to make a weatherscan-like system on the VMix streaming platform

The general concept is the use data sources in VMix to feed weather content into adaptable graphic templates made in Photoshop and adapted with GT Title Designer. The general concept would be an "open-source" Weatherscan, something that doesn't rely on The Weather Company's data or IP - as the Intellistar does.

This is being built for my weather page, the Kingsford Heights Weather Page - so content will be premade for that page, but should hopefully be easily adaptable for a variety of use cases. We will see.

If you know scripting, feel free to help!


I'll build this out more when I actually start the project.
