# weatherscan-VMix
An attempt to make a weatherscan-like system on the VMix streaming platform

The general concept is the use data sources in VMix to feed weather content into adaptable graphic templates made in Photoshop and adapted with GT Title Designer. The general concept would be an "open-source" Weatherscan, something that doesn't rely on The Weather Company's data or IP - as the Intellistar does.

This is being built for my weather page, the Kingsford Heights Weather Page - so content will be premade for that page, but should hopefully be easily adaptable for a variety of use cases. We will see.

If you know scripting, feel free to help!


I'll build this out more when I actually start the project.

The pages listed below are the hopeful end goal. I have my doubts that everything will be possible, but as I continue work, I'll see what I can make happen. These are in a non-specific order until implemented.

### Weather Alerts should interrupt any current flow - showing full alert notification and hopefully radar / alert polygon. If an alert has been updated or extended, a narrating voice should take over and say as much. (with the alert scrolling on the bottom) Alert cancelled should possibly play a graphic with an narrating voice saying as much.
